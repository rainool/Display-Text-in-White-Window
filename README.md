# textInWindow
This is a small C# experimental program I made to better understand some of the content taught in my SIT102 unit.

This program is made based off of the packages and terminal that my University taught from. 
The terminal used is the MSYS64 MINGW64 terminal with .NET installed. The compiler of choise is VS Code, using the language C#. 

This program is dependednt on the SplashKitSDK toolkit
